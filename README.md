# rpc-client

Client library for interacting with Oskari.org embedded maps

Builds on top of JSChannel

The dependency for JSChannel is not currently flagged in package.json. The current version in oskari-repository is a modified version of the original, but there are multiple forks that have bug fixes and improved support for npm like https://github.com/adtile/jschannel.

We will add the dependency when we figure out which we want to use. In the meantime a working one can be found in https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari/tree/develop/libraries/JSChannel.
